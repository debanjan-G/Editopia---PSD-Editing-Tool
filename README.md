# Image Editing Tool - Built with React and Fabric.js

This repository contains a powerful image editing tool built using **React** and **Fabric.js**, enabling users to upload images and PSDs and perform various editing actions. This dynamic tool provides an interactive canvas where users can draw, erase, add text, and apply filters to uploaded images. Users can then download the edited image. While it was initially designed to support PSD file uploads and automatic text/image layer detection, this version focuses on intuitive image editing features and offers a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Key Features

- **Upload and Edit Images**: Users can upload images directly onto a canvas and modify them in various ways.
- **Drawing Tools**: Draw freeform lines or shapes directly on the image using the drawing tool.
- **Erase Functionality**: Erase parts of the drawing or content on the canvas with a simple click.
- **Add Text**: Add customizable text to images, with control over font, size, and color.
- **Filters**: Apply filters to enhance the visual appearance of the images.
- **Delete Objects**: Easily delete individual images or text layers from the canvas.
- **Clear Canvas**: Quickly clear the entire canvas and start fresh with a new image or drawing.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the application's state.
- **Fabric.js**: For rendering and manipulating objects on the HTML5 canvas.
